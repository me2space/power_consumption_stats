power_consumption_stats
=======================

Just getting started...

I hope to gather electricity consumption data to determine what conservation methods work best based on size of dwelling and region.  Attached are graphs from 3 different locations within the Orlando area, but with your help I hope to gather more from different parts of the world.

chart1
  This graph shows considerable savings due to a floor renovation.  Old carpet was replaced with a felt underlayment and 12.3mm laminate flooring. 

chart2
  Consumption data after a re-roofing with thicker shingles.

chart3
  Still waiting to see true benefits of applying a white elastomeric roof coating on top of shingles.

Data Formatting

Create a csv file in the following format...

Conditioned Area, Zip Code
Month, Year, kWh, Notes
Month1, Year1, kWh1, Notes1
Month2, Year2, kWh2, Notes2
Month3, Year3, kWh3, Notes3
Month4, Year4, kWh4, Notes4

Fill in each year you provide completely, so use "0" if you don't have data for those months.  Use the notes field to mark when an upgrade was done or when your consumption behavior changes drastically.  For example, left on vacation for a couple of weeks, or your nephew came to stay over for a couple of days and it turned into a month.
