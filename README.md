power_consumption_stats
=======================

Just getting started...

I hope to gather electricity consumption data to determine what conservation methods work best based on size of dwelling and region.  Attached are graphs from 3 different locations within the Orlando area, but with your help I hope to gather more from different parts of the world.

  This graph shows considerable savings due to a floor renovation.  Old carpet was replaced with a felt underlayment and 12.3mm laminate flooring.

  Consumption data after a re-roofing with thicker shingles.

  Still waiting to see true benefits of applying a white elastomeric roof coating on top of shingles.
