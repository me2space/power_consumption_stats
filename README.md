power_consumption_stats
=======================

Just getting started...

I hope to gather electricity consumption data to determine what conservation methods work best based on size of dwelling and region. Attached are graphs from 3 different locations within the Orlando area, but with your help I hope to gather more from different parts of the world.

Chart1 - This graph shows considerable savings due to a floor renovation. Old carpet was replaced with a felt underlayment and 12.3mm laminate flooring.

Chart2 - Consumption data after a re-roofing with thicker architectural shingles.

Chart3 - Still waiting to see true benefits of applying a white elastomeric roof coating on top of shingles.

Data Format

Create a csv file in the following format...

Month, Year, kWh, Notes, Conditioned Area, Zip Code

Month1, Year1, kWh1, Notes1, Conditioned Area, Zip Code 

Month2, Year2, kWh2, Notes2

Month3, Year3, kWh3, Notes3

Fill in each year you provide completely, so use "0" if you don't have data for those months. Use the notes field to mark when an upgrade was done or when your consumption behavior changed substantially. For example, if you left on vacation for a couple of weeks, or if a guest stayed over for more than a few days.
